# Inference API

https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour

## Get your API Token
To get started you need to:

* Register or Login.
* Get a User Access or API token in your Hugging Face profile settings.
* https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

You should see a token hf_xxxxx (old tokens are api_XXXXXXXX or api_org_XXXXXXX).

If you do not submit your API token when sending requests to the API, you will not be able to run inference on your private models.
